    "\n",
    "We are not going to make a big effort to be consistent about the use of the following terms, since their precise meaning is still under debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertainty\n",
    "In general, we are uncertain about a logical proposition if we do not know whether it is true or false. \n",
    "In particular, we can be uncertain about:\n",
    "+ the value of a model parameter;\n",
    "+ the mathematical form of a model;\n",
    "+ the initial conditions of a ordinary differntial equations;\n",
    "+ the boundary conditions of a partial differential equation;\n",
    "+ the value of an experimental measurment we are about to perform;\n",
    "+ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty may be *aleatory* or *epistemic*. Aleatory uncertainty is associated with inherent system randomness. Epistemic uncertainty is associated with lack of knowledge. If you think too hard, the distinction between the two becomes philosophical. We are not going to push this too hard. Fortunately, our approach (the Bayesian approach) treats both uncertainties on an equal footing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Modeling\n",
    "*Predictive modeling* is the process of assigning error bars to the predictions of computational models.\n",
    "Ideally, these error bars rigorously quantify the effect of all associated uncertainties.\n",
    "Having quantified and propagated uncertainties through the computational models, one can assess the risk of making decisions based on the model predictions.\n"

    "### Uncertainty Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Question 2 above, there various reasons why a model cannot be calibrated perfectly. Some of these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ lack of data;\n",
    "+ the existence of measurement noise;\n",
    "+ the fact that the model is just not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring for the moment the possibility that the model is just bluntly wrong, we see that the lack of data or the presence of noise will induce some uncertainty in the values of the calibrated parameters. We are going to represent uncertainty on parameters by assigning a probability density on them. There are systematic ways of estimating the uncertainty induced because of the calibration process, but this will not concern us now.\n",
    "For the moment, assume that somebody told us that the uncertainty in the scaled parameters $\\xi_i$ of the model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Value |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| $\\xi_1$ |$1.35\\pm 0.05$ |\n",
    "| $\\xi_2$ |$1.65\\pm 0.08$   |\n",
    "| $\\xi_3$ |$1.34\\pm 0.11$ |\n",
    "| $\\xi_4$ |$-0.16\\pm 0.16$ |\n",
    "| $\\xi_5$ |$-3.84\\pm 0.20$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does this information actually mean? As we will discuss in the following lectures, this information can be used to assign a probability density on each one of these parameters, say $p(\\xi_i)$, that *models* our state of knowledge about them. For example, let us assume that our state of knowledge about $\\xi_1$ is given by a Gaussian probability density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\xi_1) = \\mathcal{N}(\\xi_1|\\mu_1=1.35, \\sigma^2 = 0.05^2),\n",
