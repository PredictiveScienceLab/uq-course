We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.

    "A *causal model* is a model that attempts to capture the mechanisms that govern a given phenomenon.\n",

    "A structural causal model is a collection of three things:\n",
    "+ A set of variables. These are variables that our model is trying to explain (endogenous), but also other variables that may just be needed (exogenous).\n",
    "+ A set of functions that give values to each variable based on the values of all other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most physical and engineering models are causal models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Asthma model (J. Pearl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are trying to study the causal relationships between a treatment $X$ and lung function $Y$ for individuals who suffer from asthma.\n",
    "However, it is plausible that $Y$ also depends on the air pollution levels $Z$.\n",
    "The final ingredient is the set of function that connects $X$ and $Z$ to $Y$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = f(X, Z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical representation of causal models\n",
    "Every SCM is corresponds to a *graphical causal model*.\n",
    "These are usually *directed acyclic graphs* (DAGs).\n",
    "These can be read trivially from the SCM form.\n",
    "Let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Asthma model - Graphical causal model\n",
    "Here I am representing each variable with a node.\n",

    "## The uncertainty propagation problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties can be described using probability theory.\n",
    "So, one of the first steps of predictive modeling is to come up with probability statementes for all uncertain variables.\n",
    "However, this is also one of the most difficult problems...\n",
    "So, let's assume that some has already done it for us.\n",
    "The next step is to propagate this uncertainty through the causal model to characterize our uncertainty about a quantity of interest.\n",
    "Let us do both using the trailer example."

    "### Solving uncertainty propagation problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to solve the uncertainty propagation problem is via sampling.\n",
    "This is known as the *Monte Carlo* method. \n",
    "It was invented in Los Alamos during the Manhatan project.\n",
    "We will study the Monte Carlo method extensively.\n",
    "For now, let's look at a simple example."

    "+ lack of data;\n",
    "+ the existence of measurement noise;\n",
    "+ the fact that the model is just not perfect.\n",

We are going to represent uncertainty on parameters by assigning a probability density on them. There are systematic ways of estimating the uncertainty induced because of the calibration process, but this will not concern us now.\n",
