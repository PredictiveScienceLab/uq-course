And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.

    "Y = f(X, Z).\n",

    "\n",
    "+ lack of data;\n",
    "+ the existence of measurement noise;\n",
    "+ the fact that the model is just not perfect.\n",
    "\n",

We are going to represent uncertainty on parameters by assigning a probability density on them. There are systematic ways of estimating the uncertainty induced because of the calibration process, but this will not concern us now.\n",
